# Application Prerequisites

AppShell's default views require the following named routes to exist:

| Route Name           | HTTP Method | Description                        | Used By                                   |
|:---------------------|:------------|:-----------------------------------|:------------------------------------------|
| **login**            | `GET`       | The app's login URL                | - login.blade.php<br>- register.blade.php |
| **logout**           | `POST`      | The app's logout URL               | - _header.blade.php                       |
| **password.request** | `GET`       | Displays the password reset page   | - login.blade.php                         |
| **password.email**   | `GET`       | Sends the password reset link      | - email.blade.php                         |
| **password.request** | `POST`      | Submits the password reset request | - reset.blade.php                         |

These routes are typically generated by Laravel's auth scaffolding, but these routes may or may not
be present in your application.

Additionally, this functionality (`Auth::routes()`, `artisan make:auth`) was deprecated with Laravel
6 and has been removed from Laravel 7 and moved to the `laravel/ui` composer package.
