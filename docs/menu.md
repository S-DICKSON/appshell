# The Menu Component

The menu functionality is built on top of [Konekt Menu Component](https://github.com/artkonekt/menu).
The component is automatically loaded, is fully available (incl. the `Menu` facade).

AppShell creates a menu named **appshell** which is the main menu
component, and is available in views as `$appshellMenu`.
